            The
            <a href="https://forth-standard.org/">FORTH</a>
            implementation based on
            <a href="https://github.com/philburk/pforth">pforth</a>
            that also speaks a bit of C.

         <h2>But why another FORTH?</h2>
         <p>
         I think that FORTH is an interesting language and I like to use it from
         time to time.
         When I do so, I like to use some graphics library
         (<a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>)
         and make little games with it.
         The problem is, that no FORTH implementation I know of supports C
         bindings.
         </p>
         <p>
         Yes,
         <a href="https://gforth.org/">Gforth</a>
         <i>claims</i> to support C bindings, but they are broken on
         every platform I try it on.
         This is most likely caused by Gforth devs forgetting that it's nice to
         make a release once in a while, so they ship a 10 years old version.
         You <i>can</i> compile the current version, but I don't like that.
         </p><p>
         It only works seamlessly on some platforms, requires a lot of
         additional bloat
         (latex, emacs...) and I prefer my projects to not require users to
         compile their own compiler.
         </p><p>
         This led me to making my own FORTH that supports Gforth-like runtime
         bindings.
         </p><p>
         I chose pforth as the base, as it is written in portable C
         (most implementations seem to be written in assembly for reasons)
         and has built-in feature to compile in new words, so it was easy to add
         runtime bindings.

         This is a hobby project by one guy who knows nothing about FORTH, C,
         or even language implementations in general.
         It is mainly intended to fulfill my needs and probably has a few
         bugs/flaws.
         </p><p>
         I do not try to sway you from using it.
         If you want to use C libraries with FORTH, I still believe ex:forth to
         be the best choice.
         (tell me if there is a better one, I would like to know)
         Just take it for what it is and don't expect perfection.
         </p>
         <p><b>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</b></p>

         <h2>Development status : <span class="orange">Maintenance</span></h2>
         <p>
         I'm currently focusing on projects that do not include FORTH, so
         ex:forth is not in active development (or used at all for that matter).
         I do however actively pull all changes made in pforth.
         </p>
         <p>
         Tho I'm sure that one day I will decide to pick up FROTH once again and
         more progress will be made.
         That day has just not came yet.
